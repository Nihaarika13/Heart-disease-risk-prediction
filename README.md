# Heart-disease-risk-prediction

Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are among the leading causes of death globally. Early detection and preventive interventions are crucial to reducing risks and improving patient outcomes. This project explores the application of various machine learning (ML) models to improve the accuracy and reliability of CVD prediction.

Project Description
This study evaluates multiple classification algorithms — including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest — to identify the most effective model for predicting cardiovascular diseases. After comprehensive testing, the Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of approximately 90%, minimizing misclassification rates compared to other models.

Additionally, the project extends beyond prediction to offer advanced features such as:
Real-time prediction system
AI-powered chatbot for patient assistance
Health trend analysis dashboard

These functionalities aim to deliver a holistic AI-driven healthcare solution to support early diagnosis, personalized care, and informed decision-making for CVD management.

Dataset
The model was trained and validated using the publicly available Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle.
